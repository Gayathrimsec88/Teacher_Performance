AI-Driven Multi-Model Assessment for Teacher Performance Analysis Through Audio
Abstract
This project aims to support teacher performance evaluation through an automated audio analysis system. The tool processes classroom recordings to assess clarity, engagement, and sentiment using traditional signal processing and statistical analysis techniques. It avoids demographic bias by focusing only on vocal and textual content derived from the recordings. A simple user interface displays each teacher’s performance, helping administrators monitor teaching quality and provide constructive feedback.

System Requirements
Development Environment
Google Colab or any Python-supported IDE for development and testing

Python 3.10 for compatibility with audio and text processing libraries

Core Libraries & Tools
Whisper (or equivalent speech-to-text model): For transcription and language detection

SpeechRecognition, Librosa, and TextBlob: For audio feature extraction, text-based sentiment analysis, and clarity scoring

Matplotlib/Seaborn: For graphing and data visualization

Dashboard & Interface
A custom-built Python GUI or web interface using Tkinter, Flask, or HTML/CSS/JavaScript to upload audio files and show evaluation results

File Storage & Management
Audio files and analysis results are stored locally in structured folders or in CSV/JSON formats for easy access

Text files are used to log user data and performance reports

Hardware Requirements
Processor: Minimum Intel i5/Ryzen 5 (Recommended: i7/Ryzen 7)

RAM: 8GB minimum, 16GB recommended

Storage: 50GB SSD or more

Internet: Required for downloading language models and libraries

Project Workflow
User Interface for Upload Educators or evaluators upload audio recordings through a desktop or browser-based form. The interface confirms successful upload and displays the file metadata.

Audio Handling and Transcription The system detects the spoken language (English, Tamil, or Hindi) and converts the audio into text. Noise reduction and normalization techniques are applied for clarity.

Text and Speech Analysis

The transcribed text is assessed using text analysis tools to determine clarity and tone.

Audio features like pitch, pace, and pauses are analyzed using traditional signal processing to evaluate engagement.

Scoring System Each recording receives a normalized score (0–100) based on aggregated measures of clarity, sentiment, and engagement. The formula used is simple and interpretable.

Results Presentation The system presents performance summaries through visual plots and plain-text feedback files, allowing evaluators to compare sessions and track improvement.

Conclusion
This audio-based evaluation system simplifies the process of assessing teacher performance using automated transcription and conventional analysis techniques. It emphasizes fairness by analyzing only the audio and content quality, with no personal identifiers. Using basic tools and accessible technology, it provides structured insights to support better teaching outcomes in both traditional and remote learning environments.
